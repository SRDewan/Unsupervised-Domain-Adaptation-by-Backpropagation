# Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation-by-Backpropagation

## Setup Instructions
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Run Instructions
All the code is in jupyter notebooks where we have created a separate notebook for each datset pair. Thus, the code is self-explanatry to run, just run the notebooks' cells.
